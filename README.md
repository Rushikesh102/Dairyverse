# Dairyverse - ## Dairy Management System

## Project Description
Dairyverse is a web-based dairy management project that help retailers to manage the sales and inventory of dairy products.This project consists of an B2C (Business to Customer) E-Commerce website. The project consists of two main components: the admin side and the customer side.

The admin side is primarily for internal use by the retailers. It allows them to manage their inventory, sales, and orders. The admin can add new products, update product information, and track their inventory levels. They can also manage customer orders, as well as generate reports to help them analyze their sales and inventory data.

The customer side is a user interface for customers to place orders and make payments. Customers can browse through the products available and add items to their cart. They can then checkout and pay for their order using a payment gateway.

The backend database used for Dairyverse is MySQL, which stores all the data related to products, customers, orders, and inventory levels. The project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP as its programming languages to build the user interfaces and manage the server-side functionality.

Overall, Dairyverse is a useful tool for dairy farmers and retailers who want to manage their dairy product sales and inventory in a more efficient and organized way.
